# MBR - CMS (Practical Exercise)

# Requirements
Framework: laravel and vuejs or Livewire.
- Develop this cms using Laravel and Javascript. I am not get chance to work on vuejs or Livewire

Provide a README file containing clear, simple instructions on how to execute the code and tests.
# Steps for run project
- git clone https://github.com/PramodKushwaha/mbr.git
- Move Root Project directory
- composer install
- Rename .env.example to .env and change database credentials
- run "php artisan migrate" command for import database tables

If anything needs clarification which is not detailed here, make an assumption and note this in the README file.
- As per my assumption, Need to make CMS Project for create pages with menu listing and render page content
- I have added My Working CMS Pages screenshot on Root Project > cms-page-screenshot folder
